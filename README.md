# Troubleshooting

from time to time you may see this error when starting the app:

     Error running `xcrun simctl openurl booted exp://127.0.0.1:19000`: An error was encountered processing the command            (domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain, code=60): The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. Operation timed out Operation timed out

to overcome this you have to delete the app cache from expo. You can eigther run the  clean_caches script ordelet the ./expo/cash/* folder
